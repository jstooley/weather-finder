## Usage

`basic_weather`

Based on the zip code if you would like to get `[temperature, uv index, feels like]`

```ruby
WeatherFinder::Scrapper.basic_weather(94041)

#=> ["66°", "0 of 10", "66°"]

```

`hourly_weather`

Based on the zip code if you would like to get the hourly weather. Data will be returned as two dimensional array:

`[[time, description, temperature, feels like, precipitation, humidity, wind], [.......],[.......]]`

```ruby
WeatherFinder::Scrapper.hourly_weather(94041)

#=> [["11:30 am", "Mostly Sunny", "74°", "74°", "0%", "17%", "NNE 7 mph "], ["12:00 pm", "Mostly Sunny", "76°", "76°", "0%", "16%", "NNE 6 mph "], ["1:00 pm", "Mostly Sunny", "78°", "78°", "0%", "14%", "NNE 6 mph "], ...., ....]

```

`ten_day_weather`

Based on the zip code if you would like to get the 10 day weather. Data will be returned as two dimensional array:

`[[day, description, high, low, precipitation, wind, humidity], [.......], [.......]]`

```ruby
WeatherFinder::Scrapper.ten_day_weather(94041)

#=> [["Tonight", "Clear", "--", "55°", "0%", "42%", "NNW 6 mph "], ["Fri", "Sunny", "85°", "54°", "0%", "29%", "N 9 mph "], ["Sat", "Sunny", "81°", "54°", "0%", "45%", "NNW 9 mph "], ....., .....]

```

The `weather_finder` gem also provides a command line interface(CLI). To use the CLI:

```ruby
w = WeatherFinder::CLI.new

w.call

=begin
  What is the zip code you would like to know the weather at?
  exit to quit
  94041
  **************************************
  It is currently 74°
  But it feels like 74°
  With a UV index of 5 of 10
  **************************************
  Would you like to look at the hourly or 10 day forecast?
  Type 'hourly' or '10 day' to choose.
  type 'back' to choose a different zip code.
  Or type 'exit' to quit.
=end

```
To bypass the interactive menu you can simply do:

```ruby

w.weather_hourly(94041)

w.weather_ten_day(94041)

```
